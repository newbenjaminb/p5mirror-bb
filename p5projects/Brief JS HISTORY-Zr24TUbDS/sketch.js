// Brief JS HISTORY
// https://sebhastian.com/beginning-javascript-introduction/

// 1995
//JavaScript was created around April 1995 by Brendan Eich, who at the time was working on an early browser in a company called Netscape1.

//He was told that he only had 10 days to design and code a working prototype of a programming language that can run on the browser.

// His requirement is that the language would appeal to nonprofessional programmers like Microsoft Visual Basic (which had at least a year of design and development from 1990 to 1991) and interpretable for easy embedding in webpages.

// 2005 
// jQuery and AJAX released 
// JS saw rise in popularity. jQuery and AJAX simply had no alternative technology to compete with in terms of browser interactivity, DOM manipulation and asynchronous request.

// 2009
// A server side environment named Node.js released, unlocking JavaScript capabilities to be used in backend and server side development.
// That makes JavaScript a competitor to long time server side programming language such as Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and many more.

// JavaScript is now a language that can power the web, mobile and desktop applications. It can also interact with databases and embedded into devices.
