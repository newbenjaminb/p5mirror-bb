// W6.4 EXTRA: interacting balls 
//After watching the videos on object communication (Coding Train Videos 7.6-7.7): 
// W6.4-1 Add a function to your Ball( ) class so that both balls change color if they collide. 
// W6.4-2 Take the question above and make the ballsâ€™ color toggle, turning red when a ball comes close to another ball and then turning back to white when it comes close to another ball again.
// W6.4-3 Take Challenge A and instead delete both balls when they come near each other. HINT: Beware of empty array positions!
