    when he heard    when she saw    and they walked    the world was rounded    the rustle of her gown    something moved inside    he was dumb founded    then flew like a bird    without a word    around the world    all the seeds sown    the moonlight bright    the path unwound    she heard the sound    the night was warm    her fugitive smile    the wine spilled    his words garbled    lying in the grass    into the forest    he looked askance    they danced slowly    her hands reached in    his hand sought hers    as the omen clouded    laughing softly together    the moon was milky    the dark ripples    the muddy shoe    and whom is who    it was time    she stole a glance    yes he knew    no she knew    she always knew    and he too    wet clothes by the river    skins shining in water    they swam under the moon    they felt the current pull    the dark ripples tugging    diving into darkness    splash in quiet forest    they floated below the moon
