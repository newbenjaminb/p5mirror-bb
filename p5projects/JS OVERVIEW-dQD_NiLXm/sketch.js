// JS is

// HIGH LEVEL
// the language will store values in the memory and free them when they are not used anymore. It also had rich debugging capability and more platform agnostic. simply put, JavaScript will try to make everything easy so that you can focus on the code.

// multi-paradigm
// the language does not force its developers to use any particular programming paradigm. 
// with JS you can write OBJECT ORIENTED code using prototypes and classes. You can also use anonymous functions to write JS in FUNCTIONAL programming style.
// If you had used other programming language before, you will notice how Java and Ruby encourage the use of object oriented programming. They can use functional programming paradigm, it’s just not meant to be. 

// INTERPRETED
// the language does not need to be compiled before running, as opposed to Java or Go. You can write it and then it will run.

// DYNAMICALLY TYPED
// A variable in JS can be assigned any type. You can assign an integer to a variable that holds a string without any error. In Java you can only use String variable to hold String value.

// WEAKLY TYPED 
// In a strongly typed language, you have to declare a variable’s type on initialization, for example in Java you create one like this : String var = "Hello"; But in JavaScript, simply var = "Hello";
